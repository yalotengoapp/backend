# Build workflow - Automatically builds and pushes Docker images on main branch pushes
# This workflow runs whenever code is pushed to the main branch
name: Build

# Trigger: Run on pushes to the main branch only
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

    # Use the latest Ubuntu runner for consistent environment
